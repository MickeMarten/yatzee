A simple Yatzy scoreboard application built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS using Vite as the build tool. The app allows users to input dice rolls, manage multiple players, 
display available score options, and keep track of whose turn it is. This project was built with the assistance
of Cursor AI as a way to practice and test the capabilities of AI-driven development.
